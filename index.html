          <div class="contentText">

            <p>Bombay High Court lifted the ban imposed on women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of Haji Ali dargah on 26th August, 2016 , saying it contravenes the fundamental rights of a person. And in holding that women are entitled to police protection, if needed.<!--

            <br />

           

        <p>The issue was framed before the court by The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, the women’s organisation that initiated the public interest litigation against the Dargah Trust, invoked the protection of Articles 14 and 15 (rights to equality and non-discrimination), and 25(1) (right to religious freedom) of the Constitution.

</p><br />

   



        

       

           <p> The trust responded by invoking Article 25(1) itself, arguing that Islam mandated the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum. It also invoked Article 26(b), that granted religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs in matters of religion.</p><br />

       

         

           <p> The Bombay High Court deployed essential religious test to determine the validity of the Trust's arguments. On a perusal of some passages from the Koran and the Hadith, the court found that none of this material supported the trust’s claim that Islam mandated the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum of shrines.</p><p><div class="contentText">

The trust’s claims were thrown further into doubt because right until 2012, women’s entry had, in fact, been allowed.The trust couldn't show what had changed so suddenly in 2012. Likewise, the court’s rejection of the trust’s Article 26 claims was sober and measured.</p><p>

	once the Trust could not invoke constitutional protection for exclusion of women from the inner sanctum, court concluded that exclusion clearly violated the women’s right to religious freedom, as well as their right to equality.	

</p><br /></div>

       

       

           <p> More than 80 years later, the Bombay High Court agreed with Ambedkar when it held that the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum of the Haji Ali Dargah by the Dargah Trust violated not only their fundamental right to religious freedom but also their right to equality and non-discrimination under the Indian Constitution.</p>

       

        

       <blockquote><p>“The issue is not entry, but equality” B.R. Ambedkar said when he was asked why he was so passionate about the issue of temple entry for Dalits.</p></blockquote>

                

        

        

            <div class="contentText"><p> The Haji Ali Dargah Trust is a public charitable trust so It should be open to people all over the world, irrespective of their caste, creed or sex. And State should also  ensure the safety and security of the women at such places. Although the judgement of bombay high court, authored by Justice Revati Mohite Dere, is not last that we've heard of this matter bacause The Dargah Trust will certainly appeal in Supreme Court, and the battle will move to SC, but whatever happens in the Supreme Court, Justice Dere’s judgment is a landmark ruling.
